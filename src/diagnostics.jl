    io_dictionary_aux()

These functions return a dictionary whose
 - `keys` are the nc variable names
 - `values` are NamedTuples corresponding to
    - `dims` (`("z")`  or `("z", "t")`) and
    - `group` (`"reference"` or, e.g., `"profiles"`)

# TODO: use a better name, this exports fields from the prognostic state, and the aux state.
